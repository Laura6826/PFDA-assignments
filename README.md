  Microsoft Co-Pilot was used to generate ideas of the content of the following notebook. That said, the notebook is mainly my own work, as I had to re-work the code the text in generated to meet my own needs.(*The warning icon was sourced from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50544499/how-to-make-a-styled-markdown-admonition-box-in-a-github-gist)*)

## 1. Introduction

This project was created to fufill an assessment requirement of Programming for Data Analytics 24-25: 4369, as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics.

Each week, following a series of lectures, an assignment was set, to demonstrate both learning and additional reading/research on the topics discussed in the lectures.

This repository is collection of my weekly assignments, including some additional guidance and instruction in how to run each Assignment/program.

## 2. The purpose of this project

As noted on the [assignment instructions](https://vlegalwaymayo.atu.ie/course/view.php?id=10462#section-3),

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure students can demonstrate the following:

1. Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
1. Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems.
1. Create software that incorporates and utilises standard numerical libraries.
1. Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications.

## 3. How to get started

### Necessary software

In order to run the included files, you will need to ensure that you have access to the correct softwear. I would recommend downloading the following applications (ensuring sufficent space on your hard drive prior to installation):

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) (if Anaconda is too large, miniconda would also suffice).
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (this is a code editor).

### Recommended libraries

For a seamless excutition, I would also recommend you have access to the below libraries prior to running the files:

```ruby
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
  import scipy
```

### **Additions to** *.gitignore*

A number of [additional files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global) were added to my .gitignore prior to running the programmes:

  1. python.gitignore
  2. macOS..gitignore
  3. VisualStudioCode.gitignore
  4. Linux.gitignore
  5. TeX.gitignore
  6. Vim.gitignore
  7. Windows.gitignore

## 4. How to get help

I have attached below,a number of helpful links, should you wish to extrapolate on any of the methods used within this project.

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf)
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
1. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
1. [Matplotlib.py](https://matplotlib.org/)
1. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Additionally, a number of links are embedded within the code, in areas that i found confussing/difficult, that should help should there be any difficulty.

## 5. How to contribute

As this project was created to fufill an assessment requirement of the Principles of Data Analytics, as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics, no contributions will be allowed, in order to comply with ATU Policy on [Plagiarism](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) and the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2022-08/Student%20Code_Final_August_2022.pdf).
